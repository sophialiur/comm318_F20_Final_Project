## Presentation of your data story for COMM318 _Stories from data_ Final Project

My final presentation is a report title "Suicide in the World". This report builds on the global knowledge base on suicide by analyzing existing data and literature on the epidemiology of suicides around the world. Furthermore, this report aims to not only provide descriptive statistics but also reak misconceptions, delve into the potential causes of suicide, and ultimately contribute to the existing literature on suicide prevention. 

Suicides are not unpreventable, but every single life lost to suicide is one too many--itâ€™s time to act.
