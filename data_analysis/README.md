## Data analysis notebooks for COMM318 _Stories from data_ Final Project

This folder contains the a series of notebooks for my data analysis.


My analysis is split into 2 parts: describing the data and looking for relationships. 
For the first part of the analysis I used `World Suicide Data Analysis.ipynb`, in which I explored with suicide rates data and analyzed patterns in the data, as well as prepping it for later analysis with other variables

For the second part of my analysis, I chose 6 variables that are possibly the risk factors for suicide. I created a notebook for each one of them. The process of analysis was largely the same for all of them: I first cleaned the data, checked for any obvious patterns, and then merged the data with my suicide rates data to run a regression model to see if there is a relationship
`Depression.ipynb`-looks at depression incidence in year 2016 
`GDP.ipynb` - looks at whether countries with higher GDP have lower suicide rates
`Happiness Index Data.ipynb` - looks at whether countries with higher happiness scores have lower suicide rates
`Religion.ipynb`-looks at whether countries with more religious people have lower suicide rate
`Sunshine.ipynb` - looks at if countries with sunshine duration have lower suicide rate
`Work Hour.ipynb` -looks at whether countries with longer work hours have higher suicide rate
