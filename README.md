## My final project for COMM318 _Stories from Data_ (Fall2020)

For my project I originally intended to examine suicide mortalities in Japan, but as I came across data comparing Japan to other countries in the world I realized that it is not as bad as I thought; in fact, according to data from 2016, there are 8 countries that have higher suicide rates than that of Japan's, and one of those countries is the United States. It is also shocking to see that most of the top 10 countries are developed countries. Surprised by the results, I decided to shift my focus and look in to how the high suicide rates in those countries can be explained. 

There are 2 major research questions:
* Descriptive: What are some traits of the population that committed suicide in the top 10 countries with the highest suicide rates?  (age, gender, and other categorical variables)
* Correlative: What factors are associated with the high suicide rates in those 10 countries? (economy, culture, etc.)

For the descriptive part of my project, I looked at the global distribution and prevalence of suicide, as well as the gender disparities, and other trends. For the correlative part of my project, I examined 6 possible factors associated with suicide: depression, GDP, happiness, sunshine, work hours, and religion. For each of them I also ran a regression model to determine the relationship.
